### Specialization for PDF files

- Designed specifically for handling PDFs
- Directly saves unlocked PDF files
- Doesn't require additional tools to use the cracked password

### Accessibility for beginners

- No need for knowledge of advanced commands
- Clear error and progress messages
- Ability to work without knowing technical details of password formats

### Ease of modification

- Python code that is easy to understand and customize
- Clear structure with separate functions
- Ability to quickly add new features (as demonstrated by the metadata analysis implementation)

### Simplicity of installation

- Requires only Python and the pikepdf library
- No need for compilation or configuration
- Works the same on Windows, Linux, and macOS

### Educational value

- Clear code demonstrating the basics of password cracking
- Shows practical application of cryptographic libraries
- Allows understanding of PDF security mechanisms

### Immediate feedback

- Clear progress messages in real time
- Information about each password attempt
- Detailed metadata report

## How to run the script?
1. Install python - download Python installer from the official website.
2. Install pikepdf - Windows command: ``` pip install pikepdf ```
3. Files: cracking_pdf.py and 100k_passwords.txt should be the same folder.
4. Open cmd and go to where the script is located and use command ``` py cracking_pdf.py ```

7. Option 1 - write password manually / Option 2 - AutoScan with your dictionary or default dictionary / Option 3 - Extract metadata from pdf locked (give little information about file) or unlocker (give more information about file)

> [!TIP]
> After cracking the PDF, a new PDF is created that no longer requires a password.
>
> After extracting the metadata, an file is created in which the metadata from the PDF is saved.
